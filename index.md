With the world becoming more and more connected via the internet, the ever changing global society that we now live, work and play in means we face new threats and concerns. Our lives are now online and unlike those generations before us taboos, and traditions, and instincts on for our privacy has not yet fully developed like the real world. The use of this technology is not free, we give up parts of our privacy to access websites, use social media, do online shopping, find jobs, and make use of GPS. Every time we use one of these platforms or tools, the data we give up in order to use it is collected and stored.
This data can then be used for a huge number of various reasons, some of these reasons are ethical, and some are not. Collected data is a very precious commodity that large companies such as the big five (Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon), or hackers want to gain access to. This could be done to make money by simply selling it on, holding it at ransom, or used to influence the online market via targeted adverts. 
This is all done without the vast majority of online users having any protections against their data being collected. This privacy guide will help you to be more private and safe when using the internet.
