This Website was created as a guide to online privacy as part of my dissertation project at the University Of South Wales.
The dissertation is written to research how our day to day lives are affected by online data collection, and some of the good and bad reasons it is used. The report explains these issues, its effects on society, our digital rights, and how to prevent it in an easy to understand, nuanced way explaining both sides of this argument. This guide was created in conjunction with the report to provide a simple online privacy guide to the public.
